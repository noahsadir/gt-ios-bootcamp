 TODO: PART 1
    You are given an incomplete car purchasing app, and an unimplemented CarBrand enum. The app currently uses a global dictionary (carFacts) as a way of storing the car brands and their facts. However, given the nature of dictionaries and String keys. Small mistakes in our code can go unnoticed. We would like to use enums to organize these car facts, make our car facts more maintainable, and have a less error-prone system. The car facts stored in this enum will be presented alongside every car model.
 
            (1) Implement this enum with all the different car brands (cases) and their properties (variables). Don't forget to include the brand name as a property.
            (2) Implement changes within all functions that have a TODO comment.
            (3) Test your implementation with very basic test cases.
