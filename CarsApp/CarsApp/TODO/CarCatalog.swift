 TODO: PART 3
     You are given a class called CarCatalog, with certain variables such as carsAvailable (mapping of CarModel to amount available), favourites (list of CarModels), etc.
     Implement the empty functions throughout this class - favourite(CarModel), getCarAvailability(CarModel), getAvailableCars(), filterCarsBy(brand).
     Some helper functions will already be given. Implement the class initializer to initialize your variables.
