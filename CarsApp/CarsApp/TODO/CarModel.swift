 TODO: PART 2
    The app can store general information about the car brands. However, a single car brand consists of many different cars. Newer models release every year and our app must be able to seamlessly welcome them - assume thereâ€™s an API from which this data comes from.
    Hence, we need you to create a CarModel struct that serves as a representation of a car model. We must store the:
        - brand of the car mode (HINT: canâ€™t be a String, Int, Double, etc. You already built a type for this. Do you know what that is?)
        - a model ID (String) which is already written for you as 'id'
        - model name
        - top speed (Int)
        - color (String)
        - fuel capacity (Int)
 
    Think about why we decide to use a Struct instead of a Class, perhaps itâ€™s because the data never changes?
