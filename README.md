# GT iOS Club Bootcamp

This repo contains everything you need to get started with iOS development!

We designed this with beginners in mind, though many of the resources.

## Prerequisite Courses

It's possible to succeed in this bootcamp without programming experience,
though we highly, highly suggest that you get *some* experience beforehand.

But prior knowledge of Swift, SwiftUI, or iOS dev is not necessary at all.

#### CS 1301 (strongly recommended)

This course gives you a strong foundation for programming if you have no prior
experience. Without this knowledge, it'll be quite tough (but not impossible)
to jump straight into app development.

#### CS 1331 (recommended)

This course builds on 1301 and provides a foundation for object oriented
programming, which is crucial for app development since Swift
(especially SwiftUI) use OOP concepts heavily.

#### CS 1332 (recommended)

Limited knowledge of data structures is needed if you want to work on front-end
stuff, but for complex apps you'll need to have DSA knowledge to be able to
store and process data effectively.

## Equipment

To complete the tasks in this course, you need to have a Mac with Xcode
installed.

Xcode is an [IDE](https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-an-ide) which
you'll be using to develop your very own iOS app.

It's a *very* large program and is known for installation issues, so please
start installing it right now.

[Download Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)

_Note_: You need to have the latest version of macOS to install Xcode.

#### But what if I don't have a Mac?

Because Apple loves to gatekeep, you can only download Xcode on a Mac and
that's the only way you can develop iOS apps.

This means that you won't be able to do much of the tasks here. Fortunately,
each module includes tasks that you can run in a
[Swift playground](https://swiftfiddle.com/)
if you're really devoted to learning Swift.

But you'll still be severely handicapped without a Mac, so please reach out
to your tech lead for assistance.

## Getting started

Now that you have Xcode configured, it's time to get started with the bootcamp.

You can change modules by switching branches in this repository.

Go ahead and switch to the `module-0` branch.
