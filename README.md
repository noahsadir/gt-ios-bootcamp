## Content

### Variables and Data Types

This section of the assignment will serve as a warm-up to help you get comfortable with Swift's variable and type declaration syntax. By the end, you should be able to distinguish between different data types as well as *variables* and *constants*.

- [x] Initialize variables and constants, using implicit and explicit notations.

### Operators

Here, you'll be asked to fulfill certain prompts that require the use of operators. Operators can be used to perform algebraic operations with numbers, or even combine strings. Since you'll be using them a lot during your iOS journey, we suggest being familiar with them.

- [x] Perform algebraic operations using Swift operators.
- [x] Perform String operations.

### Conditionals

Conditionals let us execute code *conditionally*. They allow us to make decisions in our code when the state of our application isn't clear. All modern languages offer conditional statements, so you may already have experience. This section should push you to learn about the syntax of conditional statements in Swift, and usage of logical operators with conditionals.

- [x] Implement conditional statements using logical operators.

### Optionals

You will find this section much more challenging than the preceding ones. This is because Optionals are a fairly unique feature of Swift, they add a protection layer to **nil** (also known as null in Java, and None in Python). With Optionals, we can write more type-safe code and express values of data types like Strings, Ints, etc. more clearly.

- [x] Referencing optionals.
- [x] Safely unwrap optionals.
