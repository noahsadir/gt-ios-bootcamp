# Module 2: More Swift Basics

In this module, we'll go over collections, loops, functions and closures.

Please note that this module is _not_ comprehensive. We'll only go over the
basics here.

Things you'll accomplish:
[ ] Create and manipulate Array objects
[ ] Create and manipulate Set objects
[ ] Create and manipulate Dictionary objects
[ ] Utilize while loops
[ ] Utilize for loops
[ ] Streamline code using loops
[ ] Create basic functions
[ ] Utilize closures for extending functions
[ ] Utilize closures for handling async data

## Getting Started

You should've cloned this repo back in module 0.

To switch to module 2, open Xcode and 

## Collections

Like most languages, Swift contains implementations of common data structures
including Arrays (aka lists), Sets, and Dictionaries (aka maps)

### Array

In Swift, the Array data structure is used to store sequences of data.

The name is a _bit_ misleading though, since it resembles what most languages
consider to be lists. Notably: Swift Arrays have the following properties:

- Dynamic sizing; you don't need to specify array size upon initialization
- Insertion, modification, and removal functions
- Advanced indexing functions
- Built-in sorting functions (similar to Java List)

### Set

The Set data structure is fairly straightforward if you've used sets in other
languages such as Java or Python.

It's assumed that you have a general understanding
